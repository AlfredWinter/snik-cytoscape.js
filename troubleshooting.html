<h2>"Javascript is off."</h2>
SNIK Graph does not work without JavaScript and uses some features of ECMAScript 6.
Please ensure that JavaScript <a href="http://enable-javascript.com/">is enabled</a> and that your browser is up to date.

<h2>The book excerpts are not accessible</h2>
Unfortunately, the textbooks are not open source and are only accessible for IMISE members.

<h2>The book excerpts are not openened at the right page</h2>
If the book is opened at page 1, you need to make sure that the file is not downloaded but opened directly in the browser.
If the book is openened at a later, but incorrect, page, please <a href="https://github.com/IMISE/snik-ontology/issues">submit an ontology ticket</a>.

<h2>Mobile</h2>
SNIK Graph is not optimized for Smartphones and Tablets, as such both the controls and performance may be unsatisfactory.

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
SNIK Graph is a research prototype developed part-time by a single researcher who is not a JavaScript expert and as such does not undergo the extensive testing and development of big projects.
As such, <a href="contribute.html">contributions</a> and suggestions are always appreciated,
However, HTML 5 and ECMAScript 6 are used by choice and we will not approve changes that compromise the clarity or size of the source code by adding compatibility layers for outdated browser versions.
